# alcochive

## what?

this is an archive tool, written in shell script

it isn't meant to be used seriously but instead for me
to go "look I made an archiver in bash lol"

there is no real reason to use this since it is slower
than all other archivers & has less functionality

## installation

see the [github releases](https://github.com/alemontn/alcochive/releases)
for available package formats (deb) as well as an install
bundle, for other distros

## building

a `package.sh` script is provided for packaging & making
bundles

to make - for example - a deb package:

  `./package.sh deb`

or a bundle:

  `./package.sh bundle`
