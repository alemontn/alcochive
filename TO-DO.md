targets are sorted from most to least concern, the
higher the target is, the more likely it is to be
fixed/implemented

### format

 * only files can be added, not directories

 * once an archive is created, nothing can be added to or
   removed from it

 * symlinks not yet implemented

 * date last modified not yet implemented

 * xattrs not yet implemented (no idea what they even are)

### cli

 * arguments have to be seperated (e.g. `-x -C /`) when ideally
   should be able to be put together (e.g. `-xC /`)

### more

 * add arch linux package
